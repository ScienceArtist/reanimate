One single video. Pause frames are stretched out to 1s.

Check video location on every frame.
If we're in a pause area, pause the video.
If we're in a loop area, reset video to previous point.

Commands:
  Pause.
  Unpause.
  Play backwards.

Playing backwards requires two videos. Can we switch video while in fullscreen?
Yes, at least in FF. Might be a good idea not to depend on this.
Instead: Concatenate the two videos, one forward and one backwards.
